This program will basically create a CSV file called "Potential_switch_ports.csv"
which constitutes a list of switch and ports that have more than 3 mac addresses learned on
The purpose of this , is that sometiems we onboard new network switches with no information 
on potential switches that should be managed or how the network is connected. While there is alot
of approaches for network discovery this is useful and handy to locate other connected switches and access points.


1 - run the first code with "python3 create_devicedb.py" this will create the device list database from user input
The supported devices are cisco/hp/dell switches. This code will create a yml file as the database using jinja2 to be usedin the next code.

2- After the first code run and the user exist. run "python3 switch-audit-2.py" this will use the database to connect to the devices using the netmiko library along with NTC template to format the show mac address table command accross devices.

The output will be the csv file .
